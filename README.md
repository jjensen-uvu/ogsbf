Optical colors for SBF: PanSTARRS g-z, DECam data retriever, and DECam g-z, g-i code. Depends on SEXtractor, Montage, monsta, and astropy

OGSBF: set up files for manual SBF analysis, repeat analysis automatically for background and PSF variations. Set up for WFC3/IR F110W only.

Linear MC least squares fits: new TRGB calibration and Hubble plots.

reprocess WFC3/IR: rerun the HST pipeline for WFC3 images using integer pixel shifts. Relies on stenv, monsta, and autoclean.
